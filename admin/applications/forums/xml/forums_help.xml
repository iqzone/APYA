There are two versions of the post editor: the standard editor and the rich text editor. Which one you use can be configured from your settings. With the rich text editor, you&#39;ll see how the post will look when it&#39;s finally posted, like a live preview.<br />
<br />
The toolbar buttons on each editor are very similar, and each button is explained below, from left to right:&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/rte_icons/remove_formatting.png&#39; /&gt; (This is only available in the rich text editor) - This will turn off all formatting tools currently in use.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/rte_icons/toggle_source.png&#39; /&gt; (This is only available in the rich text editor) - This will show the HTML source of the post and allow you to enter the post in HTML.

	<em><b>Viewing The Board Index</b></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When visiting the board, you will be presented with a list of categories and forums in those categories. This page is called the Board Index, and it lists all of the forums.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	Forums are split into categories. You can choose to hide any category by pressing the &quot;-&quot; button on the right-hand side above the list of forums, and the &quot;+&quot; button to make them visible again. If hidden, such categories, and the forums inside them, will be collapsed and no longer shown to you when visiting the board index.<br />
	<br />
	When viewing the forums, there are icons shown next to them which indicate the status of a forum, and if it has unread posts or not.</p>
<p>
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/f_icon.png&#39; /&gt; This indicates that there are posts which you have not read contained inside this forum, or one of it&#39;s sub forums.<br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/f_icon_read.png&#39; /&gt; This indicates that all of the posts contained in this forum and it&#39;s sub forums have been read.<br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/f_redirect.png&#39; /&gt; Redirect forum, when you enter this forum you will be redirected elsewhere.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<em><strong>The Topic List</strong></em><br />
	Within each forum there are a list of topics. Just like forums, each topic has an marker to indicate the type of topic it is:<br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/t_unread.png&#39; /&gt; A regular topic with unread posts.<br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/t_read_dot.png&#39; /&gt; This is a topic which you have participated in, with no new replies since you last read it.<br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/t_unread_dot.png&#39; /&gt; This indicates that you have previously replied in this topic, and there are new replies since you last read or replied to the topic.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>Special Types of Topics</strong></em><br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/t_announcement.png&#39; /&gt; This icon indicates an &quot;Announcement&quot; - Announements are not regular topics, because members cannot reply to them. They are simply important news or information which should be read.</p>
<p>
	<img src="http://content.community.invisionpower.com/global_remote_files/help_files/UXvT28.png"/> This icon indicates a hot topic which has many members participating and replying.</p>
<p>
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/t_moved.png&#39; /&gt; Topic that has been moved into another forum.<br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/t_locked.png&#39; /&gt; This indicates that a topic has been locked, and can no longer be replied to.<br />

	<br />
	To enter a any topic, click on its name.<br />
	<br />
	<em><strong>Sorting Options</strong></em><br />
	To customize the way topics are displayed, you can use the sorting options found at the top of the forum.</p>
<p>
	<img sr="http://content.community.invisionpower.com/global_remote_files/help_files/huElCk.png"/><br />
	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show type - this allows you to only display certain types of topics such as polls or topics that you have posted in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sort by - this allows you to change the way topics are ordered. By default topics are ordered with the topics that have most recently had replies first, but you can choose to sort by other factors such as the number of replies or alphabetically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sort direction - this allows you to set which way you want to sort for the setting above. For example if you set &quot;Sort by&quot; to be &quot;Replies&quot;, choosing &quot;A-Z&quot; for this setting will show the topics that have no replies first, whereas choosing &quot;Z-A&quot; will show the topics with the most replies first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time frame - this allows you to limit the topics that are shown to only topics that have been made within a certain amount of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
	<br />
	There may be more than one page of topics, if this is the case, you will see an option to &quot;Load More Topics&quot; at the bottom of the list of topics. There will also be page numbers to the left of this button.<br />
